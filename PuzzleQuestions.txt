For the purpose of these tasks, please include any assumptions you make as comments
within the code.  While unit testing is not required, including your unit tests will be
viewed favorably.  Please include a text file with your submission detailing any
libraries/compilers/etc required to run your code.

Problem #1

If we list all the natural numbers less than 10 which are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9.  The sum of these multiples is 23.  Write a function which returns
the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 less than X, where X is an integer parameter.


Problem #2

Write a FUNCTION which takes in a String as a parameter and returns a Pig Latin version
of that string.  The program should be able to :
1)      handle punctuation
2)      Ignore numbers (i.e. if “500” is passed in, “500” is passed back)
3)      Handle multiple sentences

Pig Latin translation is simply taking the first letter of a “word” and appending that
letter to the end of the word with “ay” added to the end as well.  Example:

“Alex, how did you do question 21?”  should translate to “lexAy, owhay idday ouyay oday
uestionqay 21?”
